In a world of Automation and Robotics, we as humans have all seen or thought
about technology’s potential and it’s extreme outcomes. We’re so much invested
in the future that we forget what is happening in the world around us. We see
that new inventions created for particular cause end up in the wrong hands, as
instruments to unwarranted destruction. One such creation is the Drone.


Although, the idea of a Drone was initially used for Military purpose by the
Austrians in 1849, and the fact that it started off in the modern age as a weapon,
we see drones being used innovatively now in commercial backgrounds and
free public use. The increased accessibility to drone technology has led to an
increase in terrorist usage and unsolicited intrusion. 


Drones are now being fitted with the latest in Spying hardware and weaponry.
We see Stealthy Drones which have infinitesimal RADAR signatures, some are
sound suppressed, you name a feature and there is a Drone created with it. This
increase in Tech accessibility, combined with ingenuity, pose a very big threat to
Civilian Infrastructure where innocent people thrive.

A Solution is required to tackle this problem in the civilian environment with
affordability at it’s core and reliability as a key criterion. This Project aims to
provide a concept or a working model of a system which can help Detect,
Identify and Intervene with Drones where they are not expected to be.
